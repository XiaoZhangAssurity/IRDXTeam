# IRDXTeam
This is a repository that hosts all materials we've used for playing the "buy a feature" game for IR's new ways of working while working on the digital microservice project.
We hope more teams can benefit from playing this game as a conversation starter towards defining their shared understanding of new ways of working.

We used this article as our initial guild to create the game: http://www.uxforthemasses.com/buy-the-feature/ You can find instructions on how to play the game and the paper money note we used on this website.

You can find our game content - a list of features, individual feature card, as well as a poster about why and how we created this game in this very repository.

If you are interested in taking a look at the full list of ideas we generated before selecting the top 20 for the current version of our buy a feature game, you can visit this Trello board: https://trello.com/b/MqcOQ5QC/dx-our-ways-of-working

If you are interested in playing the game with a distributed team, you can use this tool https://conteneo.co/ or drop me an email at xiao.zhang@assurity.co.nz
